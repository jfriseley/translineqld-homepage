Trans and gender diverse people have the difficult task of identifying what they need in order to feel comfortable in their body. For some this will involve hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and surgery, for others this may not be required. Trans and gender diverse people often have complex mental health needs in addition to experiencing gender dysphoria: anxiety, depression, and neurodiversity are common.

Transline QLD can connect people with community and health services. It is not a medical or psychiatric service and it cannot provide advice on trans healthcare, and it will not encourage trans and gender diverse individuals to pursue any particular form of care. 

Transline QLD has no political or religious affiliations.
